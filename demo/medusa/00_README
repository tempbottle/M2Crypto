M2Crypto HTTPS and FTP/TLS servers

All the files in this directory are from the Apr 2001 release 
of Medusa, except for the following:

- 00_README (this file)
- server.pem, the server's certificate
- ca.pem, my CA certificate
- https_server.py
- ftps_server.py
- START.py
- START_xmlrpc.py
- index.html, a sample HTML file
- poison_handler.py, a webpoison clone

By default, http_server listens on port 9080 and https_server port 9443.
Document root is current directory, and serves up index.html. 

The xmlrpc server is accessible below '/RPC2'. It requires Fredrik Lundh's
xmlrpc_handler on PYTHONPATH.

The FTP/TLS server listens on port 9021 by default. I've only tested it with
the 'anonymous' authentication handler.
