- test.py works.

- makesmime.py is sendsmime.py modified to not send
  SMTP, because I do not now have an SMTP server handy.

- sendsmime.py should still work, because makesmime.py 
  does.

- unsmime.py doesn't work, possibly because the certificates
  used to generate the tested PKCS7 objects are no longer
  available.

This directory contains various programs and supporting files 
demonstrating M2Crypto's S/MIME functionality.

- test.py exercises the various S/MIME functionality. 
- sendsmime.py (optionally) signs and/or encrypts a message, 
    then sends the output via SMTP.
- makesmime.py is exactly like sendsmime.py, except it writes
    its output to sys.stdout.
- unsmime.py decrypts and verifies an S/MIME SignedAndEnveloped 
    message. It handles the S/MIME output of Netscape Messenger 
    successfully.

- ca.pem is M2Crypto's test CA certificate.
- client.pem and client2.pem contain user certificates and their 
    corresponding private keys.

- clear.p7 is a clear-signed S/MIME message.
- opaque.p7 is a signed S/MIME message.
- ns.p7 is a clear-signed S/MIME message produced by Messenger.
- ns.se.p7 is a signed-then-encrypted S/MIME message produced 
    by Messenger.
- m2.se.p7 is a signed-then-encrypted S/MIME message produced 
    by sendsmime.py.


I tested with export and strong versions of Netscape Communicator 
4.7x.

I have also done some interoperability testing with Sampo Kellomaki's 
smime tool.

I am interested in interoperability testing with Outlook and other 
S/MIME tools. Write me <ngps@post1.com> if you want to collaborate.
