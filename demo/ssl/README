This directory contains SSL clients and servers written as demos 
and testbeds.

The oldest ones are s_server.py and s_client.py: these are modeled 
after the eponymous demo programs in OpenSSL. Once I got them going,
I moved on to Medusa and other "real-world" servers. The pair has been
in a state of neglect and quite likely no longer work with the current 
M2Crypto.

My current testbeds are the echod-* servers and echo.py. These should
always work. Note that Python on the three platforms that I test on
are built --with-threads.


Python 2.0's httplib introduces HTTP/1.1 functionality and an interface
substantially different from Python 1.5.2's HTTP/1.0 interface. 

M2Crypto.httpslib provides both interfaces. The demo programs are
https_cli.py and urllib_cli.py; these have been tested with 
Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.7.1 OpenSSL/0.9.6.
